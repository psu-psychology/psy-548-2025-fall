>This is the final thing I have done in psychology – and I will like Moses, die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.

## Imitative learning

- Many animals
  - Learn via imitation
- Many primates
  - Learn "...*because of* or *from*" others [@Tomasello2016-rx p. 643]
- Only humans
  - "...learn things *through* another individual" [@Tomasello2016-rx p. 644]

## Imitative learning

- == observational learning?
  - Perceptual & attentive requirements for?
- *Mimicry*
  - Same means
- *Emulation*
  - Same end, different means
  
## Imitative learning

- *Imitation*
  - Observed actions + apparent inference about intentions
  - plus motivation to imitate?
  - plus heightened focus on specifics of action, e.g., "overimitation"
- To signal group affiliation

## Premises

>Natural selection works with the materials of ontogeny which translate genome into phenotype, acting at every point from conception to senescence.

>Human ontogeny cannot be understood except in relation to ancestral ontogenies and those that competed with them for the limited chances afforded living forms.

-- @Konner2011-ja pp. 14-16

## More premises

>Human behavior and its development, include all of mental life, are in their entirety biological manifestations.

>As with ontogeny, and because of it, the brain has evolved by accretion.

>[No]...human trait can be understood except in terms of brain function.

-- @Konner2011-ja pp. 14-16

## Still more premises

>Despite limits to plasticity, cultural influence on human development is strong because its power is biolgically assured...To solve the apparent paradox of the powers of biology and culture is a central task of developmental research.

>Socialization is not the same as enculturation.

-- @Konner2011-ja pp. 14-16

## Human childhood is special

- Unusually prolonged
- Paralleled by protracted period of brain plasticity
- @Konner2011-ja

# Stepping back

## The social & physical environment

- Who are the people?
- What are their characteristics, roles, behaviors?
- What are culturally important artefacts?
- How do these change across development?

## On social interaction networks

## Blind men and an elephant

>Six blind elephants were discussing what men were like. After arguing they decided to find one and determine what it was like by direct experience. The first blind elephant felt the man and declared, 'Men are flat.' After the other blind elephants felt the man, they agreed.
