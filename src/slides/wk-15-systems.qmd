# On systems

## Toward and experimental ecology of human development

>...rejects as spurious the argument that, because naturalistic observation preceded experimentation in both the physical and biological sciences, this progression is necessarily the strategy of choice in the study of human behavior and development. Such an interpretation mistakes a historical sequence for a causal one...

-- @Bronfenbrenner1977-cm

## Ecological environment

>DEFINITION 2. The ecological environment is
conceived topologically as a nested arrangement of
structures, each contained within the next.

## Nested structures

- Microsystem
  - Place, time, physical features, activity, participant(s), role(s)
- Mesosystem
  - System of microsystems
- Exosystem
- Macrosystem

## On ecological validity

>DEFINITION 3. Ecological validity refers to the extent to which the environment experienced by the subjects in a scientific investigation has the properties it is supposed or assumed to have by the investigator.

-- @Bronfenbrenner1977-cm p. 516

## On ecological experiments

>DEFINITION 4. An ecological experiment is an effort to investigate the progressive accommodation between the growing human organism and its environment through a systematic contrast between two or more environmental systems or their structural components, with a careful attempt to control other sources of influence either by random assignment (contrived experiment) or by matching (natural experiment).

## Beyond the laboratory

>Laboratory tasks and stimuli lack the complexity of natural environments and may fail to capture the important statistical regularities that influence cognition – observations that have motivated calls for greater naturalism within cognitive science.

-- @Hartley2022-dd

>James Gibson famously argued for the importance of asking ‘not what’s
inside your head, but what your head’s inside of’.
