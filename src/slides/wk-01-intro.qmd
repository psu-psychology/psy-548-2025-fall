# On cognition

---

![@Bayne2019-ot](../include/img/bayne-2019.png)

## Common themes

- Processes, concepts, representations (Bayne)
- Perception vs. cognition (Brainerd)
- "acquisition, storage, retrieval and processing of information" (Byrne)
- cognition vs. learning theory (Byrne)
- representations and how coded in the brain (Byrne)

## Common themes

- mental processes; biological problem-solving; knowing about knowing; more complex than associative learning (Chittka)
- thinking, knowing, understanding; non-human animal cognition (Clayton)
- conservative, e.g., related to human thought vs. liberal, adaptive information handling and can be modelled as computation; attention; categorization (Heyes)

## Common themes

- how sensory input "is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered and used"; animal umwelt (Mather)
- less vs. more introspection/deliberation; "“requires
learning”; “isn’t a reflex”; “depends on internally generated brain dynamics”; “needs access to stored models and relationships”; “relies on spatial maps” (Ölveczky)
- "flexibility, contingency and freedom from immediacy" (Shadlen)

## Common themes

- not uniquely human; intentional vs. unintentional, conscious vs. unconscious, effortful vs. automatic, slow vs. fast processes (Suddendorf)
- "I know that I am cognizing, but I can only surmise that cognition has occurred in other animals by observing their actions."; "behaviours in which an animal performs an action directed towards a goal it cannot currently perceive" (Webb)

## How do digital computers compute?

- Strings of binary digits (bits) *represent* information
  - `0001`: the number one; `1111`: the number 15 (in base 2)
  - `00110001`: the character symbol '1' in ASCII [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-aa]
  - (some other binary 'word'): symbol meaning 'add', or 'store', etc.

## How do digital computers compute?

- Sequences of binary commands can be data or a program
- Computer has Central Processing Unit (CPU), addressable memory (addresses are also binary words), interfaces (move info in and out), etc.


## High-level computer languages

```r
x <- 3
y <- 4
h <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
h
```

- Represent
  - data as variables, e.g. `h`, `x`, and `y`
  - functions or operators as character or strings, e.g., `<-`, `sqrt()`, `^`
  - Convert to binary, then back again to give human-readable output
  
## High-level computer languages

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- 3
y <- 4
h <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
h
```

# On representation

## Surface forms

![](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/06/11/media_159bde3b0a9324b8e3cc00d1e478e8000c7e056e9.png?width=2000&format=webply&optimize=medium)

## Deep forms

- Map (relate) multiple surface forms to
  - A single deep form $\rightarrow$ the letters "A" and "G"
- "Re-presentation"
- Why? Some forms more easily "computable", more efficiently stored, less "lossy"

## @Simmering2010-ba

- Mathematical vs. verbal models
- Are verbal models poorly specified?
- Do mathematical models "just move the ambiguity to the next level"?

## @Simmering2010-ba

>Phil: That’s an interesting point—in a way, all researchers use
mathematical models when they apply statistical methods.

>Mira: Hm, I suppose that’s true. I wouldn’t normally include
statistics in my definition of computational models. I’m thinking
about models that emphasize the processes underlying behavior
and development.

## What do statistics model?

- What does a correlation (*r*) mean?

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- rnorm(n = 500, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- x + rnorm(n = 500, mean = 0, sd = 1)
cor.test(x, y)
```

## What do statistics model?

```{r}
#| include: false
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-corr-scatterplot
df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
df |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = x, y = y) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)
```

## Plot your data!

![@datasaurus2019-us; @Matejka2017-xi](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/downloads/DataSaurus%20Dozen.gif)

## Aside...

- *Simulating* your data can help reveal hidden assumptions about what your statistical model actually means, what kind of plots will best show predicted effects, etc.
- *Plotting* your data can reveal patterns that the statistics alone obscure.
- So, do statistical models inform us about *processes*?

## @Simmering2010-ba

>Phil: ...Lewis Thomas once wrote an essay listing the seven wonders of
the modern world—it was a challenge put to him in the form of a
dinner invitation which he, interestingly, declined. Do you know
what his Seventh Wonder of the modern world was?

>Phil: Thomas’s Seventh Wonder was the development of a
human child. How, my brilliant companions, are you going to
explain that?

## Cognitive models

- What do (people, e.g. children) have to *do*?
- Often the basis of creating a computational cognitive model

# On cognitive development

## Big questions

- Are some capabilities innate?
- Does children's thinking progress through qualitatively different stages?
- How do changes in children's thinking occur?
- Why do individual children differ so much from each other in their thinking?

Chapter 1 in @Siegler2021-py

## Big questions

- How does development of the brain contribute to cognitive development?
- How does the social world contribute to cognitive development?

Chapter 1 in @Siegler2021-py

## Big questions (condensed)

- Starting (or current at age X) state
- Patterns of change
- Causes of change

# Your turn

## Let's do a hierarchical task analysis!

- Pick a task you know well, use in your research
- What is required to perform it?
- (Later) what cognitive components are associated with the task?

## Is the analysis useful?

## Take homes

- A "cognitive" sensibility is about...
- Information, representations, operations/processes
- Sequences, hierarchical structures
- Solving real-world problems
- Inspired by computational systems

## Next time...

- Theoretical foundations: Piaget
  - *General Readings*: @Siegler2021-py Chapter 2; @Piaget1952-dm; @Newcombe2013-qy
