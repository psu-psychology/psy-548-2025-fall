# What is cognition?

## Cognition

![@Bayne2019-ot](../include/img/bayne-2019.png)

## Common themes

- Processes, concepts, representations (Bayne)
- Perception vs. cognition (Brainerd)
- "acquisition, storage, retrieval and processing of information" (Byrne)
- cognition vs. learning theory (Byrne)
- representations and how coded in the brain (Byrne)

## Common themes

- mental processes; biological problem-solving; knowing about knowing; more complex than associative learning (Chittka)
- thinking, knowing, understanding; non-human animal cognition (Clayton)
- conservative, e.g., related to human thought vs. liberal, adaptive information handling and can be modelled as computation; attention; categorization (Heyes)

## Common themes

- how sensory input "is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered and used"; animal umwelt (Mather)
- less vs. more introspection/deliberation; "“requires
learning”; “isn’t a reflex”; “depends on internally generated brain dynamics”; “needs access to stored models and relationships”; “relies on spatial maps” (Ölveczky)
- "flexibility, contingency and freedom from immediacy" (Shadlen)

## Common themes

- not uniquely human; intentional vs. unintentional, conscious vs. unconscious, effortful vs. automatic, slow vs. fast processes (Suddendorf)
- "I know that I am cognizing, but I can only surmise that cognition has occurred in other animals by observing their actions."; "behaviours in which an animal performs an action directed towards a goal it cannot currently perceive" (Webb)

# On computation

## How do digital computers compute?

- Strings of binary digits (bits) *represent* information
  - `0001`: the number one; `1111`: the number 15 (in base 2)
  - `00110001`: the character symbol '1' in ASCII [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-aa]
  - (some other binary 'word'): symbol meaning 'add', or 'store', etc.
- Sequences of binary commands can be data or a program

## High-level computer languages

```r
h <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
```

- Represent
  - data as variables, e.g. `h`, `x`, and `y`
  - functions or operators as character or strings, e.g., `<-`, `sqrt()`, `^`
  - Convert to binary, then back again to give human-readable output
  
## High-level languages

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- 3
y <- 4
h <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
h
```
