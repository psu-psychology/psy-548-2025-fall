# Learning from others

## What is learned?

- How
  - Actions
- What & why
  - Concepts

## What are concepts?

>mental representations that organize experience...

>mental representations that correspond to categories of things in the world, such as dogs or
chairs (Margolis 1994), I would broaden the set to include properties (green, happy), events
or states (jumping, wet), individuals (Daddy, Lassie), and abstract ideas (goodness, liberty)...

-- @Gelman2009-jg

## What are concepts?

>concepts are also embedded in larger knowledge structures (Gelman, 1996). Concepts therefore cannot be understood wholly as isolated components.

-- @Gelman2009-jg

## Where do concepts come from?

- Children's
  - Observations
  - Actions
  - Ideas
  
## Where do concepts come from?

- **Children's**
  - **Observations**
  - **Actions**
  - **Ideas**
- Others'
  - Speech
  - Actions
  
## Recall

>...we believe that humans are endowed with a small number of separable systems of core knowledge. New, flexible skills and belief systems build on these core foundations.

-- @Spelke2007-ts

## Core knowledge domains

- Objects
- Numbers
- Agents
- Social partners
- Space
- Shapes

## Core knowledge domains

- Objects
- Numbers
- **Agents**
- **Social partners**
- Space
- Shapes

## From perception to cognition 1

## From perception to cognition 2

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  E[Episode_1] ---> O[Object]
  O ---> S((Shape))
  O ---> L((Color))
  O ---> D((Distance))
  O ---> M((Motion))
  O ---> N((Sound))
  S ---> C(Child)
  D ---> C
  L ---> C
  M ---> C
  N ---> C
  C --->|perceives| P{Properties}
  P --->|stores| Y{Memory_1}
```

## Store perceptual features

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  Y{Memory_1} --->|Shape is| S(("round"))
  Y --->|Color is| L(("red"))
  Y --->|Distance is| D(("within arms reach"))
  Y --->|Motion is| M(("rolling along floor"))
  Y --->|Sound made| N(("none"))
```

## Next episode

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  E[Episode_2] ---> O[Object]
  O ---> S((Shape))
  O ---> L((Color))
  O ---> D((Distance))
  O ---> M((Motion))
  O ---> N((Sound))
  S ---> C(Child)
  D ---> C
  L ---> C
  M ---> C
  N ---> C
  C --->|perceives| P{Properties}
  P --->|stores| Y{Memory_2}
```

## Are memories ==?

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  Y{Memory_1} --->|Shape is| S(("round"))
  Y --->|Color is| L(("red"))
  Y --->|Distance is| D(("within arms reach"))
  Y --->|Motion is| M(("rolling along floor"))
  Y --->|Sound made| N(("none"))
  Z{Memory_2} --->|Shape is| S
  Z --->|Color is| L
  Z --->|Distance is| E(("out of arms reach"))
  Z --->|Motion is| M(("rolling along floor"))
  Z --->|Sound made| N(("none"))
```

::: {.incremental}
- Do features match (mostly)
- Some features vary more often than others
:::

## Create "conceptual" placeholder

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  C{{"Round-Red-Rollie-Thing"}} ---|is| Y{Memory_1}
  C ---|is| Z{Memory_2}
  Y <---> Z
```

## Assign perceptual properties

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  C{{"Round-Red-Rollie-Thing"}} --->|Shape is| S(("round"))
  C --->|Color is| L(("red"))
  C --->|Distance is| D(("within or outside arms reach"))
  C --->|Motion is| M(("rolling along floor"))
  C --->|Sound made| N(("none"))
```

- Distance can vary, but color, shape, sound do not
- Motion?

## From associative learning to semantic networks

## Where do concepts come from?

::: {.incremental}
- Children's own actions & observations
- **Others'**
  - **Speech**
  - Actions
  - Inferred mental states, including intentions

## Next episode

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  E[Episode_3] ---> O[Object]
  E ---> P[Person]
  P --->|says 'ball' to| C(Child)
  O ---> C
```

::: {.fragment}

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  P[Person] --->|says 'ball' to| C(Child)
  O[Object] ---> C
  C --->|hears| B{'ball'}
  C --->|perceives| D{Object properties}
  D --->|activates placeholder for| E{{"Round-Red-Rollie-Thing"}} 
```
:::

## Heard word linked to placeholder

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  E{{"Round-Red-Rollie-Thing"}} --->|Name for is| B{'ball'}
  E --->|Color is| L(("red"))
  E --->|Distance is| D(("within or outside arms reach"))
  E --->|Motion is| M(("rolling along floor"))
  E --->|Sound made| N(("none"))
  E --->|Shape is| S(("round"))
```

## Wordbank: Vocabulary norms

## Wordbank: Item trajectories

![<https://wordbank.stanford.edu/data/?name=item_trajectories>](../include/img/wordbank-ball-bed-alligator.png)

## Why word learning matters

- Lexicalization
  - Different $\rightarrow$ $\neq$ concepts
  - Implies "more stable, enduring, unchanging construal..." [@Gelman2009-jg p. 121]
- Contexts in which words are used, features of words, pragmatics
  
## Essentialism

- Some categories have *essential* properties
- Cultures vary in 
  - what categories have essential features
  - degree of views about essentialism 

## Essentialism

- Cues to essentialism in adult language
  - Appearance vs. reality
  - Highlighting categorical differences
  - Broad descriptive statements about category
  - Generics ("Professors are absent-minded" vs. "My professor is scatter-brained.")

## Where do concepts come from?

- Children's own actions & observations
- Others'
  - Speech
    - **What is said, by whom, to whom, where, when, & how, etc.**
    - i.e., Testimony
    
## Where do concepts come from?

- Children's own actions & observations
  - and **concepts**
  - and **questions**
- Others'
  - Speech
    - What is said, by whom, to whom, where, when, & how, etc.
    - i.e., Testimony
    
## Example: Questions

- On their weekly drive home, Sonny notices and comments on a big apartment building.
- Mimi describes it as a place where big kids live that has many smaller houses inside.

::: {.fragment}
>That's a big house where big kids live. (Sonny)
:::

::: {.fragment}
>Yes, that's a building where big kids live. There are small houses inside. (Mimi)
:::

## Questions 2

>I want to see it. (Sonny)

::: {.fragment}
>We can't go in there. (Mimi)
:::

::: {.fragment}
>Why?
:::

::: {.fragment}
>Only the people who live there and their friends can go inside. (Mimi)
:::

## Learning abstract concepts 1

- At dinner time, Mommy puts grapes in the section of Sonny's plate where they usually put noodles.

::: {.fragment}
>That's not kind, Mommy. (Sonny)
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Mommy suppresses laughter. Later tells Grandpa the story.
:::

## Learning abstract concepts 2

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  E(Ellie) --->|reads book about kindness to| S(Sonny)
  S --->|infers properties of| K{kindness}
```

::: {.fragment}
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  Z(Zander) --->|pushes| S(Sonny)
  E(Ellie) --->|says Z wasn't kind| S
  S --->|infers properties of| N{not-kindness}
  N ---|is the opposite of| K{kindness}
```
:::

## Learning abstract concepts 3

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  S(Sonny) --->|infers properties of| N{not-kindness}
  N ---|involves| P[a person's behavior]
  N ---|is| E[surprising]
  N ---|evokes| H[negative feelings]
```

## Learning abstract concepts 4

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  E(Ellie) --->|puts grapes in noodle place| S(Sonny)
  S --->|feels| H[negative feelings]
  S --->|perceives| F[surprise]
  H --- N{not-kindness}
  F --- N
```

## Learning abstract concepts 5

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  N{not-kindness} --->|provides label for feelings for| S(Sonny)
  S(Sonny) --->|says| K(("that's not kind"))
  K --->|directed to| E(Ellie)
```

## Learning from testimony

- Speaker characteristics
  - Reliability
  - Knowledge about domain
  - Age
  - How say (pragmatics, grammatical features), not just what
  - Social characteristics (linguistic similarity)
- @Sobel2013-lb

## Psychological characteristics

- Informant knowledge can differ (by topic, characteristics of speaker, ...)
- When child knowledge uncertain, irrelevant speaker characteristics can influence
- Biases to trust familiar adults
