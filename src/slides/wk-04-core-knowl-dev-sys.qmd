# Prelude

## Today's topics

- Nativism, core knowlege, and its discontents
  - *General Readings*: @Spelke2007-ts; @Spencer2009-jo; @Spelke2009-xx; @Landau2009-jl; @Spencer2009-xu
  
# Background

## Active inference

>...creatures use an internal forward (generative) model to predict their sensory input, which they use to infer the causes of these data.

-- @Da-Costa2020-cy

## Active inference

## Active inference simplified

## Why active inference is useful

- Predict the future (sensory or internal states)
- Produce effective actions
- Detect novelty (sensation $\neq$ prediction)

## Ecological approach

![@Newcombe2013-qy Table 1](../include/img/newcombe-2013-tbl-1.png)

- Biologically relevant properties of environment useful for meaningful action (affordances) are perceived directly

# Core knowledge

## Domains

- (Inanimate) Objects
- Agents and actions
- Number
- Geometry

## What core knowledge affords

- Interpreting/understanding perceptual information
- Predicting future events
- Acting under uncertainty

## Moving beyond nurture vs. nature

>On one view, the human mind is a flexible and adaptable mechanism for discovering regularities in experience: a single learning system that copes with all the diversity of life. 

>On the competing view, the human mind is a collection of special-purpose mechanisms, each shaped by evolution to perform a particular function.

-- @Spelke2007-ts

## Moving beyond nurture vs. nature

>...both these views are false: humans are endowed neither with a single, general-purpose learning system nor with myriad special-purpose systems and predispositions. Instead, we believe that humans are endowed with a small number of separable systems of core knowledge. New, flexible skills and belief systems build on these core foundations.

-- @Spelke2007-ts


# Developmental systems critique

## Origins of core knowledge

>developmental scientists should no longer embrace ‘endowments,’ ‘primitives,’ ‘core knowledge,’ ‘essences’ (Gelman, 2003), or other static concepts that devalue developmental process. After all, ‘endowments’ are bestowed, not developed.

-- @Spencer2009-jo

## Evolution and development

> the fact that organisms evolved does not remove the need to explain developmental process, because brain and behavior are shaped through development, not programmed before development.

-- @Spencer2009-jo

## Methodology and style

>...nativists routinely extrapolate well beyond the data, making bold claims about time points not directly under investigation...

>We contend that more satisfying accounts can be found through rigorous developmental analyses that embrace process, complexity, and evolutionary history.

-- @Spencer2009-jo

## In defense of core knowledge

>This commentary argues that the dialogue between nativism and empiricism is a rich source of insight into the nature and development of human knowledge.

-- @Spelke2009-xx

## What's innate?

>Innate means not learned, and so claims of innateness and learning are mutually dependent. The second reason is conceptual: Any learning mechanism necessarily requires unlearned abilities for detecting and analyzing inputs and for drawing inferences, and so claims of learning inevitably presuppose a set of
innate capacities. 

-- @Spelke2009-xx

## Core knowledge vs. developmental systems

>...does a perspective promote understanding of currently known phenomena and thinking about current problems? Second, does it foster new lines of research?

> We argue here that the nativist–empiricist dialogue scores high on both measures. In contrast, Spencer et al. provide no evidence that their developmental process approach
passes either test.

-- @Spelke2009-xx

## Core knowledge vs. developmental systems

>The empirical tools of psychology and cognitive neuroscience allow us to test specific claims of innateness and learning with a vast array of methods, and to target levels of analysis from molecules to mind and action.

-- @Spelke2009-xx

# Stepping back

## What is this debate about?

::: {.incremental}

- Is "innate" a useful construct? [@Spencer2009-jo; @Spencer2009-xu]
- Are we debating or in dialogue? [@Spencer2009-jo; @Spencer2009-xu; @Spelke2009-xx]
- Does every theory need primitives and processes? [@Landau2009-jl]
- What constitutes *experience*? [@Spencer2009-jo; @Spencer2009-xu]
- Is learning $\neq$ innate

:::

## What is the debate about?

::: {.incremental}
- How to account for the speed, consistency, etc. of cognitive development [@Spelke2009-xx]
- How does (and should) evidence from neuroscience inform these questions [@Spelke2009-xx;@Spencer2009-jo; @Spencer2009-xu]
- How does (and should) evolutionary theory shape developmental theory? [@Spelke2007-ts; @Spencer2009-jo]
- How computational/statistical perspectives shape developmental theory? [@Spelke2007-ts; @Spencer2009-jo]
:::

## What about the domains themselves?

- Objects vs. agents?
- Geometry: Layout vs. landmarks?

## Knowledge

- Knowing that (semantic) vs. knowing how (procedural)

## Peripheral vs. central origins

>It is often proposed that human psychological functions develop from the periphery inward: Perception and action develop on the basis of sensory and motor experience, and reasoning develops on the basis of perception and action.

-- @Spelke1992-re

## Peripheral vs. central origins

>...a number of psychologists have proposed that there are crucial differences between perceptual and motor processes on the one hand and central cognitive processes on the other..

-- @Spelke1992-re

## Peripheral vs. central origins

>Whereas perception and action depend on a collection of relatively autonomous mechanisms that develop rapidly under internal constraints, thinking depends on processes that operate and develop more slowly, without the internal constraints that a modular architecture would impose.

-- @Spelke1992-re

## Peripheral vs. central origins

>We will explore a different view of cognitive development, traceable in part from Descartes (1637/1956) and Kant (1929) to Chomsky (1975). Cognition develops from its own foundations, rather than from a foundation of perception and action.

-- @Spelke1992-re

## Active representations and core knowledge

>...young infants are capable of reasoning: They can represent states of the world that they no longer perceive. By operating on these representations, infants come to know about states of the world that they never perceived. 

-- @Spelke1992-re

## Active representations and core knowledge

>young infants' reasoning accords with principles at the center of mature, commonsense conceptions.

-- @Spelke1992-re
