## Today's topics

- Check-in on hierarchical task analyses (HTA)
- Background ideas
- Theoretical foundations: Piaget
  - *General Readings*: @Siegler2021-py Chapter 2; @Piaget1952-dm; @Newcombe2013-qy
  
## Check-in on HTA

- Relevance?
- Utility?
- Do task demands/abilities change across development?
- What are the tasks of the infant, toddler, pre-schooler, etc.?

## On state spaces

>...a mathematical model of a physical system that uses state variables to track how inputs shape system behavior over time.

>...These state variables change based on their current values and inputs, while outputs depend on the states and sometimes the inputs too.

@Wikipedia-contributors2025-hc

## On state spaces

>...The internal state variables are the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent the entire state of the system at any given time...

## On state spaces

>In computer science, a state space is a discrete space representing the set of all possible configurations of a system...State spaces are useful in computer science as a simple model of machines. 

@Wikipedia-contributors2025-zs

## On state spaces

- Representations $\rightarrow$ states ($s$)
- Processes $\rightarrow$ changes in state across time
  - $s_{next}=s_{now}+x$
- Time scale of states, changes?
  - $s(t+1)=F(s(t))$

## On state spaces

- What is the state of the child's mind/brain/body at time *t*?
- How does that state change over some time interval?
  - Short term: behavior
  - Longer term: learning or adaptation or development
  - *Really* long term: evolution

## On reflexes

>In biology, a reflex, or reflex action, is an involuntary, unplanned sequence or action and nearly instantaneous response to a stimulus...

>A reflex occurs via neural pathways in the nervous system called reflex arcs...

@Wikipedia-contributors2025-cf

## On reflexes

>These neural signals do not always travel to the brain, so many reflexes are an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought.

@Wikipedia-contributors2025-cf

::: {.fragment}
- "Reflect" events from the world to the nervous system
- Idea credited to Descartes [@Descartes2001-ma] and Hall [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-xl]
- Earliest to emerge behaviors

## On reflexes

- What is the input? What is the output?
- What purpose(s) do reflexes serve?

## The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

@Castilla2007-cq

## The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

![@Wikipedia-contributors2025-lq](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Simple_vestibulo-ocular_reflex.PNG)

- Stabilizes gaze in allocentric coordinates
- Within ~10 ms

## On reflexes

::: {.incremental}
- Sensations and responses temporally linked
  - Causally (mechanically) linked via
  - Specialized neural circuits
- Sensation $\rightarrow$ Response $\rightarrow$ (New) Sensation
- Imagine a mechanism that "records" these links
- (Random) Response $\rightarrow$ Sensation
  - Sensation $\sim$ (Recorded prior) Sensation
:::

## Aside: Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

- One of many behavior systems that reduce "noise", improve reliability in input
- Input "reliability" improves over long time span

## Visual acuity in young children *not* adult-like

- Mind/brain/body as a mechanism
- State space formalism aids specifying states and transitions

# On Piaget

---

![Jean Piaget from @Wikipedia-contributors2025-cq](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Jean_Piaget_in_Ann_Arbor.png)

## Core ideas

- Origins of knowledge (epistemology)
- Categories of knowledge
  - Space, time, classes/categories, causality
- Reflexes innate
- Child as "scientist", solving "problems"

## Core ideas

- Stages (and sub-stages)
  - Sensorimotor (0-24 mos)
  - Preoperational (2 - 6 or 7 years)
  - Concrete operations (6 or 7 - 11 or 12 years)
  - Formal operations (11 or 12 - 14 or 15 years)
  
## Core ideas

- *Schema* [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-ad]

>...describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them. It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.
  
## Core ideas

- *Assimilation* 

>fitting new information into pre-existing cognitive schemas [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-cq]

::: {.fragmewnt}
- *Accommodation* 

>taking new information in one's environment and altering pre-existing schemas in order to fit in the new information [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-cq]
:::

## Core ideas

- *Equilibration*

>integrating individual pieces of knowledge into a unified whole. [@Siegler2021-py p. 24]

## Core ideas

- Means (how to do/actions)
- Ends (what to do/goals)
- Means-ends analysis central to AI and the science of problem solving [@Wikipedia-contributors2023-nd]
  
## Core ideas

- [*Primary circular reactions*](https://dictionary.apa.org/primary-circular-reaction){preview-link="true"}
  - Repetition of a volitional, non-reflexive act [@APAdictionary-vt]
- [*Secondary circular reactions*](https://dictionary.apa.org/secondary-circular-reaction){preview-link="true"}
  - Actions taken for their effects on the environment [@APAdictionary-vt]
  
## Core approach

![Figure 2-1 from @Siegler2021-py](../include/img/siegler-alibali-fig-2-1.png)

## Core ideas

- Detecting "sameness" 

>To be able to recognize the same thing again as it evidence itself to one's senses in a multiplicity of ways, thus affording multiple opportunities to accumulate and apply information about it is, I believe, the most central challenge there is for cognition -- @Millikan2017-to

## Core ideas

- Tasks that require the detection of some sort of sameness
  - Object permanence
  - Conservation of number, solid & liquid quantity
  - Perspective taking1
  - Number

## Core approach

- Qualitative observations of behavior
- In experimenter-chosen situations or tasks
- Observations $\rightarrow$ inferences about unseen mental processes
- Inductive reasoning [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-wz]
- Inspired by semiotics [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-ej]?

## Questions

- How does Piaget view the question of cognitive continuity vs. discontinuity?
- Are the relations among sensations and actions described in @Piaget1952-dm clearly specified that you could write out the schema?

## Notable comments

>To assimilate a sensorial image or an object, whether through simple assimilation, recognition, or generalizing extension, is to inser it in a system of schemata, in other words, to give it a "meaning".

@Piaget1952-dm, p. 189

## Notable comments

>Secondary circular reaction, in so far as it is a reproduction of an interesting result fortuitously obtained, is, effect, far from constituting a behavior pattern peculiar to the child. An adult, unacquainted with machinery, does not behave differently from the baby when, having by chance touched part of a motor, he does not understand the effect produced and repeats the action which set it in motion.

@Piaget1952-dm, p. 207
