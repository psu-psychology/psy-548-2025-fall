## About

This page provides some additional information relevant to the discussion about @Smith1999-xz and @Munakata1997-zx.

## @Thelen2001-dz

Thelen, Smith and colleagues followed up on their empirical work in @Smith1999-xz with a dynamic field model described in @Thelen2001-dz.

The modeling effort begins with a task analysis as described in Figure 1.

The model begins by describing a movement field.

The movement field receives task input and specific input from a separate input field shown below and a memory field (not shown).

Figures 10 and 11 show illustrations of how the input and memory fields evolve with repeated trials at the A location.
